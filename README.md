## CSC 242 - Reversi

### How to build & Run the project (with Command Prompt & Windows)
1.  Go to the src/ folder.
2.  Type "javac Game.java" to build the game.
3.  Type "java Game" to run the game.
4.  The code will run 1 game of Reversi/Othello.
    If you want to play the game again, start again from step 2.

### Limitations
1.  If the player (you) does not choose the random agent (1) or the H_Minimax agent, the game will run out of memory for Reversi/Othello size 6x6 and 8x8. That means any game with size 6x6 or 8x8 must run a random agent or a H_Minimax agent.
